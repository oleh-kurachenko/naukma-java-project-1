# NaUKMA Java Project 1 "University"

Study project from NaUKMA (National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy) Java
course at year 1 of the bachelor program.

The goal was to make the model of University (teachers in cathedras, students in
groups and faculties, etc.) as classes in Java, and make proper CLI for creation
and modifying such a model.

This was the first "big" project in the course, and was done in group with
another student, Polina Shlepakova.
